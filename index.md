My name is Yujie Wu. My contact information is [here](https://mathematics.stanford.edu/people/yujie-wu).

Starting fall 2024, I am a fifth year graduate student in the [math](https://mathematics.stanford.edu/)  department at Stanford University. My advisor is [Otis Chodosh](https://web.stanford.edu/~ochodosh/).

My research area is Differential Geometry, Analysis and PDEs. In particular, I am interested in [minimal (hyper)surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_surface); I have recently worked on projects that study how the ambient manifolds' geometry (in particular their curvature assumptions) influence the topology and geometry of their immersed and embedded stable minimal (hyper)surfaces. I am also thinking about the [Allen-Cahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen%E2%80%93Cahn_equation) equation and their relations to minimal surface theory.
